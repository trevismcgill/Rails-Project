# README

Welcome to my third appilcation built for the Flatiron Software Engineering Program!

This application, similar to my CLI project, was focused on D&D. The purpose of this app is to allow a user to create characters and campaigns to keep record of their D&D shenanigans!

* Built on Ruby version 2.6.1

# Getting Started

Simply clone down the app and run `rails s` to boot a local server.

Navigate to '/' to see the home page and proceed from there.

Enjoy!
